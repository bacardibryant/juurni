# juurni
A project for test driving around with indexDB within the browser. Juurni is a browser based daily journal app that allows users to select a calendar date and add ideas, memories, moments, notes, recollections, you name it for the day.

Each journal entry is saved to the browsers indexdb as a key/pair object. Being that this project was just an exploration of indexDB, all CRUD actions have not been implemented.

In order to see the saved journal entries, you must use the browser's developer tools and navigate to storage, and then finally, if it is supported, indexDB.

I'm not sure if I'll finish this the project completely as there are many, feature rich, journaling applications available.

Juurnii makes use of the calendar plugin offered by https://github.com/yscoder/Calendar.
